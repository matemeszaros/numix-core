# Contributing to Numix Core

## Contribution process
If you want to contribute to this project by making new icons you must follow our [guidelines](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core/wiki/Guidelines). You can use these instructions as reference:

1. Fork our GitHub repository.

2. Create the new icon using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (free and open source)

3. Push it to your forked repository.

   > Remember to write a proper commit message ([example guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).

   > If you are working on an open issue you can automatically close it using some keywords and the issue number ([more info here](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)).

4. Create a new pull request. It helps if you include a sample of your icon here in PNG format ([example](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core/pull/1422)).

   > Remember to create a different pull request for each icon you want to submit.

5. When the pull request is accepted you can delete your fork or [sync it](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/). Now, you are ready to create new one!
